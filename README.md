# Spotify-and-YouTube-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In this project, I implemented various Machine Learning Algorithms to analysis the data that I got from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube.

Algorithms include:
1. **Linear Regression:**
   - *Purpose:* Predicts a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.
   - *Application:* Used in regression analysis to understand the relationship between variables.

2. **Neural Networks:**
   - *Purpose:* Models inspired by the human brain, comprising interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.
   - *Application:* Used for complex pattern recognition, image and speech recognition, and various machine learning tasks.

3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):**
   - *Purpose:* A type of neural network with multiple layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.
   - *Application:* Suitable for tasks requiring non-linear mapping between inputs and outputs.

4. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):**
   - *Purpose:* Dimensionality reduction technique that finds the linear combinations of features that best separate classes.
   - *Application:* Used in classification problems to improve computational efficiency and reduce overfitting.

5. **Principal Components Analysis (PCA):**
   - *Purpose:* Reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most of its variability.
   - *Application:* Commonly used for feature extraction and visualization.

6. **Multi-Dimensional Scaling:**
   - *Purpose:* Visualizes the pairwise dissimilarity between data points in a reduced-dimensional space.
   - *Application:* Used for exploring relationships and similarities in high-dimensional data.

7. **Gaussian Mixture Models:**
   - *Purpose:* Probabilistic model representing a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
   - *Application:* Used for clustering and density estimation in unsupervised learning.

8. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
   - *Purpose:* Classifies data points by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes.
   - *Application:* Effective for both classification and regression tasks, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

9. **Decision Trees:**
   - *Purpose:* Represents decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure.
   - *Application:* Widely used for classification and regression tasks, easily interpretable.

10. **K-Means:**
    - *Purpose:* Clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on similarity.
    - *Application:* Used for grouping data points into clusters based on similarity in features.
