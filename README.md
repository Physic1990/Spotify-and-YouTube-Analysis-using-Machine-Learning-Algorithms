# Spotify-and-YouTube-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In this project, I implemented various Machine Learning Algorithms to analysis the data that I got from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube.

Algorithms include:
1. Linear Regression
2. Neural Networks
3. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
5. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
6. Multi-Dimensional Scaling
7. Gaussian Mixture Models
8. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
9. Decision Trees
10. K-Means and many more.
